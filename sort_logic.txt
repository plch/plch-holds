This is the logic for sorting into the different main agency sheets for the
Holds No Copies Excel workbook

note: 
    1. the first_item_itype is taken from the first listed item attached to the bib (if
    available)
    
    2. the call number is first attempted to be retrieved from the first listed
    item attached (so as to look at the normalized version); if there isn't a
    call number in that location, it is pulled from the bib record.
